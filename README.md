# NGINX Unprivileged Docker Image

This Dockerfile creates an NGINX Docker image that runs NGINX as a non root, unprivileged user. Notable differences with respect to the official NGINX Docker image include:

* The default NGINX listen port is now `8080` instead of `80` (this is no longer necessary as of Docker `20.03` but it's still required in other container runtimes).
* The default NGINX user directive in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` has been removed.
* The default NGINX PID has been moved from `/var/run/nginx.pid` to `/tmp/nginx.pid`.
* Change `*_temp_path` variables to `/tmp/*`.

Docker Hub images are built and pushed on a weekly basis (every Monday night) for the `amd64`, `arm32v5` (for Debian), `arm32v6` (for Alpine), `arm32v7`, `arm64v8`, `i386`, `mips64le` (for Debian), `ppc64le` and `s390x` architectures and can be found at <https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged>.

Check out the [docs](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) for the upstream Docker NGINX image for a detailed explanation of how to use this image.

**Note:** Issues related to security vulnerabilities will be promptly closed unless they are accompanied by a solid reasoning as to why the vulnerability poses a real security threat to this image.
